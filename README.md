# Paramotor Drone
# by: Emily Grau, Nicholas Restivo, Alex Valencia 
Georgia Institute of Technology - ECE 4180 Fall 2018

The goal of this project was to create a paramotor drone to simulate and collect data on the autonomous control of parafoils for future use in designing a system for the controlled landing of care packages.  

This paramotor drone is an mbed based project.  The payload was constructed to give forward thrust to the parafoil and create lift.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
